### Turn Logic

How a turn plays out:

    - Each team member's current effects are applied to them
    - The player selects a move and a target
    - The move's effects are looped through
        - Calculate if the effect misses
        - Calculate if the effect is dodged
        - Calculate the effect's strength
        - Apply the effect to the target
        - If the effect is unsuccessful and later effects rely on it being successful, then further effects are skipped 
    - If the move has a cooldown, the charge is set to the recharge value
    - The turn ends
    - Depending on the game mode, the next team member's turn begins or the enemy team's turn begins

### Game Modes

    - One Move Per Team (You can use one move per turn)
    - One Move Per Character (Each character uses one move per turn)
    - One Move Per Player (Each player controls one character and picks one move per turn)
    - Basic Tournament ('One Move Per Team' games are played in rounds)
    - Team Tournament ('One Move Per Character' games are played in rounds)
    - Solo Tournament ('One Move Per Player' games are played in rounds)
    - Ultimate Tournament (Teams and Individual players play against each other in rounds)
